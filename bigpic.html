<b>The Big Picture: Taking Your Photography to the Next Level</b> is a practical guide for the advanced-amateur photographer seeking to professionally present themselves and their work, whether it be for exhibition or sale, or simply for the living room wall. There are plenty of resources out there to help people take better pictures; this guide is geared toward a business, not a technical, point of view.
<br>
<br>
<div class="subTitle">You've built up a nice little portfolio - what's next?</div>
<br>
 
My name is Eric Ryder and I am a photographer and consultant, by trade. I have a permanent presence in a well-regarded gallery in the Napa Valley, and several other large venues. I've been down this road before, and want to share my knowledge of what it takes to sell your prized images. Everything from your best online options to the most effective business cards to examples of a Press Release and other important documentation. The information presented here is not as simple to find as you might think; surfing the web led me down more wrong paths than right ones.  This book aims to help you avoid my mistakes.
<br>
<br>
 
<div class="subTitle">You need help getting to the next level</div><br>

• How do you mount, mat, and frame your work for sale and/or exhibition?<br>
• What kind of documentation do you need when selling fine art?"<br>
• Where can you realistically sell your work?<br>
• What sizes should you start with?<br>
• What materials should you be using?<br>
• What can you do yourself, and what should you pay someone else to do?<br>
• How can you save money on materials?<br>
• How do you market your work?<br>
• How much money should you expect to make?<br>

      work?<BR><BR>

<div class="subTitle">Here are a few testimonials from my readers</div><br>
 
<div align="center"><div class="testimonial">Dear Eric,<br><br>

I am writing to tell you a story about the impact your E-book had for me.  I am a very amature photographer who has been shooting for a few years.  I have come to simply love photography and about two years ago I started donating framed photographs to nonprofits for their silent auctions.  They always sold well and I received great feedback, which inspired me to do more donations because it was so fun to see someone, or several “someones”, bid on the art.  So, recently I had a conversation with a friend who owns a very busy community coffee house.  He invited me to show my photographs– a real exhibit!  I was so excited, and a nervous wreck all at once.  I talked to a portrait photographer colleague about the best ways to frame, etc.  He sent me to a framer in town who he thought would be helpful.  Long story short – I hated what the framer was trying to convince me to do.  Just did not feel right, and it was really expensive.  So, I sat down at my computer and googled “how to frame photographs for exhibit” and your e-book came up.  I immediately downloaded it and I must say it was the best $11.95 I have ever spent!  Thank you for all the practical advice and links to resources.  I had 16 photos to matt and frame, and your advice saved me lots of money and frustration.  Thank you so much for sharing your expertise!<br><br>

My show was up for three months, and I sold 5 pieces.  I had made arrangements to donate half of the net proceeds to a local charity, and so the coffee house waived their fees.  They got nice publicity, the charity gets a little money, and I had the most wonderful experience of having my first photography show.<br><br>  

Thank you so very much ~ <br><br>

<div align="center"><div class="testimonial">Thank you! I've been looking for a no-nonsense book to help me get started selling my photography. Your advice is direct and to the point; links to material suppliers; exact pictorial directions on mounting, matting, and framing; easy to understand and implement. I was about to make a big mistake in framing- you saved me 10 times the price of the eBook. <b>David Lu, Jacksonville, FL</b>

<div class="subTitle">Get Started!</div><br>
Personally, I spent <i>thousands</i> of dollars getting started selling my work in a few venues. I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that <i>most</i> of that amount was wasted because I didn’t understand the business. I invested in the wrong frames, mats, glass, etc. In a variation of Murphy’s Law, everything I could do wrong, I did - in spite of my research. To my frustration, I was unable to find the answers to some fairly basic questions. Thus, I took forays I shouldn’t have: shortcuts, poor quality materials, and paying someone to do the work I could have done myself, (if I’d only known how).  I wrote this book to chronicle my experience for others who'd like to get thier images out into the marketplace, generating income.  I only wish someone had written this book for me!  It will quickly and easily pay for itself - and if, for any reason, you are not satified, just return it and I'll refund your money, no questions asked.
