Mission UK

Kim and Guido are two people we meet on our flight to Heathrow.  They're the quiet, mysterious, type.  What are they trying to hide?

After a few days of travel, Eric comes to Terri and Joel and Janine with a story that, from documents he happens to see in their room, that they are extreme left-wing activists, creating a dossier of evidence to use against Donald Trump.  The evidence is mostly true, but they are using this trip to create phony evidence to better support the real evidence.  This is a dangerous mission, and they dont want to endanger any innocent people, which is probably why they haven't confided in their newfound, liberal, friends.

He postulates that there plan is to attach themselves to a small group of Americans as a cover for their nefarious doings.  They often take off at night and return early the next morning.  Eric says he caught them once with an envelope they quickly try to hide from him.  He suggests that they seemed very nervous and suspects that perhaps Trump is aware that there is someone in the UK asking questions.  It's now a race against time to see if he can catch them in the act before they leave the country.

Eric convinces that they need to be careful and not let on that they know Kim and Guido are up to something.

In the last scene, we're flying back.  Kim and Guido are not on the plane.  

In the wrap up at the end, it says that Trump found out who they were, from an anonymous tip, and had them detained at Heathrow before boarding.  The Trump team - who call themselves, "The Weirdos" - whisk them away from the airport for interrogation.  They strongly deny any wrong-doing and don't know how the evidence came to be in their luggage.  The evidence is destroyed, and Kim and Guido are let go, after days of being strapped to a chair and forced to watch Fox News 24x7.  They come out convinced of Trump's greatness, and fly home to become Trump campaign volunteers.

But the day after they get home, they're greeted with headlines showing the very evidence they were caught with!!  Clearly, a copy had been made and somehow managed to get out to the media.  The question is how could this have happened, and by who...?

The last scene is a picture of Eric in sunglasses, riding on the train in Ireland, with the video clip of the countryside whisking by, to the tune of... (some classic moving sound, perhaps).
