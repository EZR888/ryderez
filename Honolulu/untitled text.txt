Title Deed
 If you own your property as a tenant in common, it's best to create a TOD deed on your own (without the other tenants in common). That TOD deed will transfer only your share of the property to the TOD beneficiary when you die.

Example: Raymond and Jack, who are brothers, own a house together as tenants in common. Raymond signs a TOD deed that leaves his half-interest to his daughter. At Raymond's death, his daughter will become a tenant in common with Jack.

"1. Title Insurance. A property owner encountered difficulty with the revocable TOD deed her
mother recorded. The revocable TOD deed was recorded without the common questions pages.
Her mother passed away. The beneficiaries on the revocable TOD deed were four children. The
children could not get title insurance on the property due to the revocable TOD deed being
recorded without the common questions pages, and were unable to sell the property. The
children had to go through probate to clear title. This bill appears to resolve this issue."
