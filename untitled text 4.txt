 I can recommend cold showers, posture correction and heated blanket on neck. Has reduced intensity for me. Some days its still quite bad but avg better than earlier this year. Took piracetam 30 days at 4g/day, that didn't help /w loudness until about 12 days in but then I did the other stuff I mentioned so hard to say if it was mainly that or delayed response. I suspect overall it helped with habituation a bit. Other supps ginkgo, b1 b2 b6 (p5p) b9(quatrefolic), b12 (methyl) for homocysteine, nerve health; I take them all separately, most b multis are trash or overpriced, gelatin/glycin, lots of mag, iodine, selenium, bunch of other stuff less likely to be related. also quit caffeine daily and am day fasting (IF) most days, 3-4h feeding window early in the day so it doesn't impair sleep.

If I don’t hear from you by [date] with a clear intent to move forward, I’ll assume you’re not interested in resolving this. At that point, I’ll be closing all communication channels related to this project — including email, phone, and text — and I won’t see or receive anything further you send.


I can have "my lawyer” draft a formal communication emphasizing the severe legal consequences of breaching any transfer of rights agreement which would very clearly forbid me using the code in any way, including forking it.
There could be substantial financial penalties and injunctive relief.
I understand your concerns, and that is why I'm willing to use a legally binding contract.

If I don’t hear from you with a clear intent to proceed by [date], I’ll consider this matter closed. I will not be responding to any future communication about the project.
