<p>The boys laughed and lay down again in the sand, while Granser sighed  ponderously. He had eaten too much, and, with hands clasped on his  paunch, the fingers interlaced, he resumed his maunderings.</p>

<p>"'The fleeting systems lapse like foam,'" he mumbled what was evidently  a quotation. "That's it&mdash;foam, and fleeting. All man's toil upon the  planet was just so much foam. He domesticated the serviceable animals,  destroyed the hostile ones, and cleared the land of its wild vegetation.  And then he passed, and the flood of primordial life rolled back again,  sweeping his handiwork away&mdash;the weeds and the forest inundated his  fields, the beasts of prey swept over his flocks, and now there are  wolves on the Cliff House beach." He was appalled by the thought. "Where  four million people disported themselves, the wild wolves roam to-day,  and the savage progeny of our loins, with prehistoric weapons, defend  themselves against the fanged despoilers. Think of it! And all because  of the Scarlet Death&mdash;"</p>

<p>The adjective had caught Hare-Lip's ear.</p>

<p>"He's always saying that," he said to Edwin. "What is scarlet?"</p>

<p>"'The scarlet of the maples can shake me like the cry of bugles going  by,'" the old man quoted.</p>

<p>"It's red," Edwin answered the question. "And you don't know it because  you come from the Chauffeur Tribe. They never did know nothing, none of  them. Scarlet is red&mdash;I know that."</p>

<p>"Red is red, ain't it?" Hare-Lip grumbled. "Then what's the good of  gettin' cocky and calling it scarlet?"</p>

<p>"Granser, what for do you always say so much what nobody knows?" he  asked. "Scarlet ain't anything, but red is red. Why don't you say red,  then?"</p>

<p>"Red is not the right word," was the reply. "The plague was scarlet.  The whole face and body turned scarlet in an hour's time. Don't I  know? Didn't I see enough of it? And I am telling you it was scarlet  because&mdash;well, because it was scarlet. There is no other word for it."</p>

<p>"Red is good enough for me," Hare-Lip muttered obstinately. "My dad  calls red red, and he ought to know. He says everybody died of the Red  Death."</p>
