Welcome to your practice Eric.  Let’s begin with you to make yourself comfortable as you begin to settle into comfort with your eyes open and your chin level. Roll your eyes up as if you are looking into your own eyebrows keeping your eyes up, take a deep breath and sending your breath low into your belly, and then let it go take another deep breath in filling and relaxing your belly, and as you breathe out welcome a sense of ease into your entire body take another breath and this time as you breathe out, allow your eyelids to gently close sending a signal to your body and mind that you are safe and it’s time for relaxation  Allow yourself to drift deeper into an internal state and awareness of yourself. Give yourself permission to fully let go into this experience let go of responsibilities. There is nothing for you to do now simply relax, become aware of where your body needs the support beneath you begin to feel your experience and sensations  Rather than labels or stories really tap into the felt sense you may feel the contact where you meet your support as heaviness warmth or even tingling. Whatever you were feeling is just right recognize that because you are being held here you are supported so you are safe to let go into this experience  Now invite your focus to scan through the sensations in your body like a flashlight moving around within you until it stops and one feeling the sensation that draws your attention. Most prominently simply noticed the sensation. What are you feeling right now stay with his felt experience without the need to change anything , as you breathe in to this area, you might imagine that you can breathe right into this part of your body directly through your skin. Allow your breath to continue supporting you. If this sensation could give you a message what would that message be right now what does your body need you to know  Now begin to welcome a softening to come into your body invade a sense of surrender to this moment invite a sense of trust. Let the tension of your body seem to fall away as you exhale, creating a lightness of being know that you were supported know that you were safe.

Now begin to use your imagination as you continue to drift deeper into a relaxed state call to mind a younger version of yourself from an age where you may have needed a little safety and support or a time when you needed love and to know that everything was going to be OK  You may see a photo of yourself in your mind or remember an event from your past whatever shows up is perfect and remember you are reviewing the past and not reliving it so you can let go of the stories and labels that may show up and simply be with this younger you  if it feels right to you, placed one hand on your belly and one hand on your heart to connect on a deeper level with yourself and your inner child in your mind, hold this younger version of yourself close offer them a loving hug if you like, tell your younger self that they matter they are relevant  They are lovable and good enough as they are. Tell them that you will love them unconditionally and keep them safe and tell them anything else you know they need to hear let your inner child know you are here for them. You can sense that they know you are OK and therefore they know they will be OK , a sense of comfort is a building between the two of you and unconditional love is filling the experience now imagine in your inner child becoming part of you merging with your heart, your body and your life so that you can always keep them safe and loved. Your inner child is always in your heart now , take a deep breath in and feel your heart opening as you do and as you breathe out, feel the gentle compression as if your lungs are giving your heart and your inner child a hug with this healing you can go deeper still.

Welcome to your practice Eric.  Let’s begin. I invite you to make yourself comfortable.

Allow your body to relax and settle in to enjoy this Hypnosis. Let’s begin.

Make yourself comfortable.  As you begin to settle into comfort, with your eyes open and your chin level, roll your eyes up as if you are looking into your own eyebrows, keeping your eyes up.  

Take a deep breath, sending your breath low into your belly, and then let it go. Take another deep breath in, filling and relaxing your belly.  And as you breathe out, welcome a sense of ease into your entire body.  

Take another breath, and this time as you breathe out, allow your eyelids to gently close, sending a signal to your body and mind that you are safe, and that it’s time for relaxation.

Allow yourself to drift deeper into an internal state of awareness of yourself. Give yourself permission to fully let go into this experience.  Let go of responsibilities. There is nothing for you to do now.  Simply relax.  Become aware of where your body meets the support beneath you.  Begin to feel your experience and sensations, rather than labels or stories.  Really tap into the felt sense.

You may feel the contact where you meet your support as heaviness, warmth, or even tingling. Whatever you are feeling is just right.  Recognize that because you are being held here, you are supported so you are safe to let go into this experience.

Now invite your focus to scan through the sensations in your body, like a flashlight moving around within you until you've gone head to toe.  Allow your breath to continue supporting you. 

Now begin to welcome a softening to come into your body.  Invite a sense of surrender to this moment.  Invite a sense of trust.  Let the tension of your body seem to fall away as you exhale, creating a lightness of being. 

Know that you are supported.  Know that you were safe.  

Now begin to use your imagination, as you continue to drift deeper into a relaxed state.
