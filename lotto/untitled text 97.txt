To sell a car with a loan in California and transfer the title, you'll need to first satisfy the lien on the vehicle, which means paying off the outstanding loan balance. The lender holding the lien will then release the title to the new owner once the loan is paid in full. You'll then need to complete the title transfer process with the California DMV. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Satisfy the Lien:
Contact your lender: Determine the exact payoff amount from your lender. 
Negotiate with the buyer: Once you have a buyer, arrange for them to pay the sale price to the lender, covering the loan payoff amount. 

Pay off the loan: If you have a negative equity (you owe more than the car's value), you'll need to cover the difference between the sale price and the loan payoff. You may need to secure a personal loan or refinance the car loan to cover this.
 
2. Title Transfer:
Lien release:
.
The lender will electronically release the title to you once the loan is paid off. 
Complete the Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability (NRL):
.
This form (REG 138) is crucial for transferring the title. You can complete this form online with the California DMV. 
Gather necessary documents:
.
You'll need the title (or a replacement/transfer application if the title is missing), the signed title from the seller, and buyer's signatures. 
Submit to DMV:
.
Submit the completed NRL form and any other required documents to the California DMV along with the necessary fees. 
Update records:
.
The DMV will update its records to reflect the new owner and issue a new registration card. 
Important Considerations:
Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability (NRL):
.
You must complete and submit the NRL form within five days of the sale to the California DMV. 
Negative Equity:
.
If you owe more than the car is worth, you'll need to cover the difference to the lender before the title can be released. 
Title Transfer Fees:
.
The buyer is responsible for the title transfer fees when they register the vehicle with the DMV. 
Electronic Lien and Title (ELT):
.
Most lienholders now utilize electronic lien and title systems, which streamlines the process. 
Smog Test:
.
If selling to a private party, ensure the car passes a smog test before the sale, as it's the seller's responsibility.

Below are a few **ready‑to‑paste deterministic wheels** that are popular with
5‑of‑N games.  Each wheel is:

* **Deterministic** – always the same sets, no randomness.
* **Compact** – only a handful of tickets.
* **Guaranteed** – you get at least the stated match if the draw falls
  completely inside the numbers you wheel.

I’ve also shown how to drop any of the tables straight into your page so the
user can copy them (or have the app export them) instead of typing one ticket
at a time.

## 1 A 12‑number wheel in **6 tickets**   (G​(12,5,2)=6)

> **Guarantee:** if the 5 winning numbers are all inside your chosen 12
> numbers, **you will hit at least one 4‑of‑5 ticket**.

| # | ticket |
|---|----------------|
| 1 | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| 2 | 1  2  6  7  8 |
| 3 | 1  3  6  9 10 |
| 4 | 1  4  7  9 11 |
| 5 | 2  3  7 10 11 |
| 6 | 2  4  6 10 12 |

## 2 An 18‑number wheel in **9 tickets** (≃ 6 × 6 ticket‑price)

> **Guarantee:** at least one 4‑of‑5.

| 1 | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| 2 | 1  6  7  8  9 |
| 3 | 1 10 11 12 13 |
| 4 | 1 14 15 16 17 |
| 5 | 2  6 10 14 18 |
| 6 | 2  7 11 15 16 |
| 7 | 3  6 11 17 18 |
| 8 | 3  7 10 15 17 |
| 9 | 4  6 12 15 18 |

---

## 3 A 20‑number wheel in **12 tickets**   (G​(20,5,2)=12)

> **Guarantee:** at least one 4‑of‑5.

(There is no shorter wheel with a 4‑of‑5 guarantee for 20 numbers.)

| 1 | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| 2 | 1  6  7  8  9 |
| 3 | 1 10 11 12 13 |
| 4 | 1 14 15 16 17 |
| 5 | 1 18 19 20  2 |
| 6 | 2  6 10 14 18 |
| 7 | 2  7 11 15 19 |
| 8 | 2  8 12 16 20 |
| 9 | 3  6 11 16 19 |
|10 | 3  7 12 17 20 |
|11 | 4  6 12 15 20 |
|12 | 5  7 10 16 18 |

## 4 How to let the user **drop a wheel into your app**

Add one helper and two lines:

```js
// 1) put all your wheel templates in one place
const WHEELS = {
  '12/6/4of5': [
    [1,2,3,4,5], [1,2,6,7,8], [1,3,6,9,10],
    [1,4,7,9,11], [2,3,7,10,11], [2,4,6,10,12]
  ],
  '18/9/4of5': [
    [1,2,3,4,5],  [1,6,7,8,9],  [1,10,11,12,13],
    [1,14,15,16,17], [2,6,10,14,18], [2,7,11,15,16],
    [3,6,11,17,18], [3,7,10,15,17], [4,6,12,15,18]
  ],
  /* … add more … */
};

// 2) when the user picks a wheel button
function loadWheel(key){
  generatedSets = WHEELS[key].map(combo => ({
      combo,
      points: calculateRawPointsForSet(combo)   // reuse your scorer
  }));
  showWheelInModal();   // same logic you already call after random search
}
```

Then create three **tiny buttons** next to “Generate Sets”:

```html
<button onclick="loadWheel('12/6/4of5')">Load 12‑num × 6</button>
<button onclick="loadWheel('18/9/4of5')">Load 18‑num × 9</button>
<button onclick="loadWheel('20/12/4of5')">Load 20‑num × 12</button>
```

No typing – the tickets appear instantly in the modal and can be exported the
same way as your random wheels.

---

## 5 Is a small deterministic wheel “better” than your random search?

| goal | tiny deterministic wheel | ad‑hoc random wheel (your current code) |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Guarantee** | Yes – provable 4‑of‑5 (or 3‑of‑5) if the draw ⊆ your pool | None.  You *usually* cover most 3‑sets but can miss. |
| **Few tickets** | Pre‑engineered to be minimal | You decide the count; may need many to get same coverage |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed size: e.g. exactly 12 numbers | Works with any Top‑N, any set count |
| **Compute time** | Instant (just a table) | O(minutes) if you ask for hundreds of sets |
| **Ease of use** | One click once you store the wheel | Already good, but you need to export / sort manually |

For **5 or 6 tickets** total, deterministic wheels give you a stronger
guarantee.  If you are happy buying **30 – 60 tickets** then your random
algorithm already covers ≥ 95 % of all 3‑number combinations, which is good
enough that the theoretical edge of a covering design mostly disappears.

---

## 6 Want a different wheel?

* **Up to 20 numbers** – I’ve included the most common minimal wheels above.
* **More than 20 numbers / special guarantees**  
  Use free tables from:
  * Brouwer & Schrijver covering archives  
    (search “covering designs G(v, k, t)”)
  * Lotto‑Designer© page – has many “lotto–wheel” tables ready to copy.

Drop any table into the `WHEELS` object and you’re done.

---

### TL;DR

* Paste the wheel tables you like into a `WHEELS` constant.
* Add a tiny “Load deterministic wheel” button that copies the table into
  `generatedSets`.
* Deterministic wheels shine when you only want **5‑10 tickets**; above that
  your current random coverage is almost as good.

Enjoy wheeling without hand‑copying!
