Tasks:

Directional Differences:  Measures directional bias (a classic, strong metric).
  Top Minus Bottom (T - B) – Measures directional bias (a classic, strong metric).
  Right Minus Left (R - L) – Tests for lateral bias (complements top-bottom).
  Center Minus Ends (C - E) – Checks for attraction to middle or outward spread.

Variance & Distribution:  (σ², Density, Clustering) - Captures overall variability in distributions.

Specific Targets: (00, 0):  A specific, targeted metric for unique clustering.
  Sum of 00 Hits – A specific, targeted metric for unique clustering.
  Sum of 0 Hits – Another specific metric that pairs with 00 for additional analysis.
