> Is blog image performance necessary?
> 
> Consider this:
> 
> Your users don’t want to wait more than 3 seconds for your page to load.
> 
> Google pays attention to your website speed and ranks it accordingly.
> 
> So I’d say yes, it’s very necessary.

<p>This Jekyll template was crafted in order to be used by photobloggers. If the photos you upload are not optimized, the page loading time will increase significantly! </p>

> DO NOT upload an image at its full size, such as 2500 x 3500, and then resize it in the settings after you’ve uploaded it to your blog!
