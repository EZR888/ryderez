<p>"Eric is one of those architects who knows how to make an implementation work and work well. He is a trusted colleague with an empathy for the customer and he just doesn't quit until he makes it RIGHT. When I managed Eric he was put into many situations where the customer was not happy. In every situation, he did the job on time and on budget and the customer was satisfied. He brings his performance skills to the architecture portion of his portfolio. That means that his infrastructure designs perform at scale! This aspect of an infrastructure design is sometimes overlooked...Eric always insures that the design will work when the load gets overwhelming. He is a top drawer architect!"<b> ~ Thomas Rouse,
Principal Engineer, EMC</b></p><br />

      <p>"I have worked with Eric on several projects and I have leaned on his expertise. He is only have handful of people that know Documentum to its core. Eric has excellent customer relations skills, which is very rare these days.Eric is an experienced consultant that will bring up any issues early if they need attention, yet he is very independent. I highly recommend Eric, for he would be a major asset to a professional services team, or any team that is highly technical and interfaces with customers."<b> ~ Tim Noonan, President, CEDS</b></p><br />

A great speaker, excellent communicator and a thorough gentleman, who knows his strength very well and complements any Architect with skills that are not common, we worked together on same set of tools (Documentum and more) but his vast experience and knowledge brought a lot more to any project. 
He was always our go to Performance guru who readily helped when we reached out. His willingness to help and pleasant personality made it great to work with him. It’s a pleasure to work with Eric."<b> ~ Akshaya Shah, Sr. Architect, EMC</b></p><br />

<p>"I worked with Eric at Documentum and EMC for over 12 years. Throughout that tenure, Eric was always the “top gun” to resolve complex customer issues especially when it came to architectural strategy and performance optimization. Eric was always in tremendous demand and consistently delivered beyond expectations. Eric also went beyond his job role to help with other areas and activities within our organization such as sales and business processes improvement. Eric will be a great asset to any organization."<b> ~ Michael Nicholson, Solutions Consultant, IBM</b></p><br />

<p>"Eric is a consummate professional who is not afraid of a challenge. Eric and I worked together on a very high profile challenging engagement. I was the project manager and Eric was the Sr. Architect on the project. The client, a large sports shoe manufacturer, needed help optimizing performance for their digital asset system, so they could reduce the time it took to get a photo from the field to production. Eric with his easy going personality was able to quickly form a tight working bond with the client team. He swiftly analyzed their system performance issue through a systematic approach and resolved the problem. Eric is great at focusing on a problem and getting to the root of the issue. Not only is Eric a great technologist he is also very dependable. When Eric makes a commitment for a deliverable he keeps his promise even when it means working the weekend to achieve it. Eric’s easy going demeanor combined with his technical capabilities makes him a great resource for any team. I would work with Eric anytime because he brings great value to the team."<b> ~ Don Dietz, Technical Program Manager, EMC</b></p><br />
