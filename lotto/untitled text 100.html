Middle ear protocol and anihistamine basically overlaps each other. Use them both and increase daily doses of vitamin D (best to take is ADEK in liquid form - drops).

Other thing is the unit does not startup consistently for me, sometimes the WIFI and sound doesn't start, so I have to resrat it a few time, but I've gotten it gin every bight so far.  3 days in.  No big surprises, but I remain optimistic.

Retell - how do they handle accounts / sessions

Command transcript
integrate with a Chat window session

Call in or referred by doctor
or referred by a friend

retell


My notes on the Call:

The Good:

*  The voice was pleasant, female, and sounded natural and almost like a real person. 

* The advice given was exactly what I have heard from many other sources on my particular issue/event.

* The interaction was smooth and natural.

Things to look at:

*  Obviously, the "time" issue - though it wasn't that bad as long as the response was fairly quick on my end.

*  The Module questions were asked, but I felt confused about what kind of interaction we were having: Was this going to be a "discussion" about my response, and my noting it in the Workbook was just basically note-taking?  Or, was I just filling out a spreadsheet with my responses and then the AI Agent would go through my answers after (when?) and give me suggestions?

*  I asked the AI Agent if she wanted me to give her my answer verbally, as well as write it in the Workbook.  She said Yes.  I gave her my response, and she answered - as I said, with a very appropriate answer.

*  I asked her if it was possible to get a written response from her, and she said to "copy / paste" it from the Chat.  Of course, there is no text chat to copy from, but she wasn't aware of that.

*  The wrap-up was good.

Things To Do:

1)  I'll do some reading on Retell's site and see what I can find about account management and security.

2)  I'll see if there's a way to pop open a Chat window like you see in most big retailers, etcetera.  

3)  I'll look into if there's a video stream that can be created of an AI-generated real human, like an AI girlfriend.  Where she speaks and the voice-to-text appears in the Chat window.  The user can type their answer or speak it, and if they speak it, it gets converted to text for the record.

4)  I'll look into if/how the Chat text can be shoved into the spreadsheet, or if there's a different / better way to store the data.

5)  I'll look into if the AI conversation that's actually happening, like when you login to ChatGPT and have a text-based conversation, is captured in the same way, so that future logins to this account will have all the info the chatbot needs already, without having to feed it a spreadsheet.  That would be ideal.

*  I'll look into the built-in privacy / security protections of AI conversations, and see if they rise to the level of HIPPA compliance.

"Yes, Retell AI is fully HIPAA-compliant, ensuring secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI). All interactions processed through Retell AI are encrypted in transit and at rest, adhering to strict data security protocols. The system enforces role-based access control (RBAC), multi-factor authentication, and audit logging to prevent unauthorized access. Retell AI integrates with HIPAA-compliant EHR systems such as Epic, OpenDental, and eClinicalWorks, allowing seamless and secure data retrieval. Additionally, Retell AI does not store sensitive patient information beyond the required timeframe, reducing compliance risks for healthcare organizations."

"Retell AI offers seamless integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems, enabling automated updates and real-time access to patient data. It connects with major platforms such as Epic, OpenDental, Dentrix, ChiroTouch, and eClinicalWorks to synchronize appointment schedules, verify patient records, and log call interactions automatically. The AI can check provider availability, update patient visit history, and retrieve essential health data while ensuring HIPAA compliance. This integration allows healthcare staff to manage patient communications more efficiently, eliminating manual data entry and reducing errors. By streamlining EHR workflows with AI, healthcare organizations can enhance operational efficiency, reduce administrative costs, and improve overall patient care."


Once I've gone through all this, we will have notes to ask an AE and/or a consultant.
